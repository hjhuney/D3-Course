# Firestore Databases

Firestore is a NoSQL database. Similar to JavaScript objects. 

To use Firebase, go to [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/). Click "go to console" in upper right hand corner. Create project. Once you've created your project, you can go to the dashboard, "Develop" -> "Database" -> "Create Database (Cloud Firestore). We can then add a collection. Inside collections are "documents".
